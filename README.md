# LAB 36, 37, 38 - Storefront

## Project: ToDo-App

Author: Adrienne Frey

### Problem Domain/Features

Phase 1:  For this assignment, you will be starting the process of creating an e-Commerce storefront using React with Redux, coupled with your live API server.

Phase 2: Continue work on the e-Commerce storefront, breaking up the store into multiple reducers and sharing functionality/data between components.

Phase 3: We will be connecting our Virtual Store to a live API so that our data is persistent and able to be separately managed.

Phase 4: Complete work on the Virtual Store by adding detail pages for individual products as well as the the cart checkout page.
